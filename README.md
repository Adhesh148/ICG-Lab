# ICG-Lab
A code repository pertaining to Lab of Interactive Computer Graphics. 

The lab begins with simple geometric algorithms and moves to exploring C/C++ libraries related to graphics such as graphics.h (only for a lab) and mostly OpenGL.

## Table of Contents

* [Week-1](Week1/)
> It contains simple algorithmic problems related to lines and primitives.

* [Week-2](Week2/)
> Introduces graphics.h library in C. graphics.h is not supported in gcc, should be downloaded separately (even so setfillstyle() does not work). Contains code for primitive shapes and simple drawings using primitives.

* [Week-3](Week3/)
> Introduces OpenGL library in C. Contains codes to draw a house and a car using combination of primitives. Circle algo should be tuned.


## Pre-requiste

## Running the codes
